    "version": "1.0.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "gulp": "*",

        "gulp-util": "*",
        "gulp-rename": "*",

        "gulp-livereload": "*",
        "gulp-concat": "*",
        "gulp-uglify": "*",
        "gulp-watch": "*"
    }
}

now CMD> npm install , it will install all dependencies.

Your gulp is ready now use it the way you want.

Check gulpfile.js and package.json in this same folder.
